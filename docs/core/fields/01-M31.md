# A Gentle Yet Thorough Tour of **`Field.M31`**

This document is an extended commentary on the Haskell source file `Field.M31`, reproduced above.  It intertwines three stories at once.  The first story introduces the arithmetic of the finite field  \(\mathbb F_p\) where the prime modulus is the Mersenne prime \(p = 2^{31}-1\).  The second story explains why a purely functional, strongly typed language such as Haskell is a natural setting for this sort of mathematics.  The third story walks through the actual implementation line by line, illuminating the way the algebra maps onto efficient bit-twiddling on modern hardware.

## 1 Finite Fields in One Page

Every finite field \(\mathbb F_q\) has \(q = p^n\) elements, where \(p\) is prime and \(n\) is a positive integer.  In this module we restrict attention to the simplest and most ubiquitous case \(n=1\).  Concretely, an element of \(\mathbb F_p\) is just an integer \(x\) in the range \(0 \le x < p\), with addition, subtraction, and multiplication performed modulo \(p\).  Division is defined by multiplying with an inverse \(x^{-1}\) which exists for every non-zero \(x\) thanks to Bézout’s identity and, more elegantly, to Fermat’s little theorem
\[
x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}, \qquad x \ne 0.
\]

## 2 Why a Mersenne Prime Makes Life Sweeter

A Mersenne prime is a prime of the special form \(2^k-1\).  Because the binary representation of such a number is \(k\) ones in a row, reduction modulo \(p\) admits a delightfully cheap formula
\[
x \bmod p \;=\; (x \!\gg\! k) \;+\; (x \;\&\; p).
\]
Intuitively, we chop the integer \(x\) into the high bits \(x \!\gg\! k\) and the low bits \(x \;\&\; p\) and simply add them.  A single conditional subtraction then suffices to finish the job.  When \(k=31\) the entire routine fits comfortably into the 64-bit integer unit of a modern CPU.

## 3 A Functional Detour:  Haskell and Algebra

Haskell’s type system lets the programmer say “a value of type `M31` *is* a field element” and, crucially, enforces that statement at compile time.  Because `M31` is a `newtype` around `Word32`, the compiled code is exactly as fast as hand-rolled C, yet the source code carries the additional guarantee that you can never accidentally pass an out-of-range raw integer to a function that expects a field element.  Laziness and purity further ensure that every expression denotes an unchanging mathematical value, making equational reasoning about programs feel as natural as algebra itself.

## 4 Tour of the Code

### 4.1 Module Header and Language Extensions  

The pragmas `{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}` and friends allow automatic deriving of type-class instances for the `M31` newtype without manual boilerplate.  The module exports **only** smart constructors and approved helpers, never the raw constructor, thereby preserving the field invariant.

### 4.2 The Constant `modulus`  

The hexadecimal literal `0x7fffffff` is \(2^{31}-1\).  A quick mental check confirms the pattern: thirty-one ones in binary.

### 4.3 The `M31` Newtype  

Because `newtype` has no runtime cost, a value of type `M31` really is just a `Word32` in disguise.  The deriving clauses give us `Eq`, `Ord`, `Bits`, and `NFData` essentially for free.  Note how the `Bits` instance is reused to support the shift operators inside reduction routines.

### 4.4 `mkM31` and the Two Faces of Reduction  

The function `partialReduce` takes an *already somewhat small* integer—guaranteed to be below \(2p\)—and conditionally subtracts \(p\).  The full `reduce` goes one step further: it handles an input of up to \(p^{2}\), which is more than enough for a single 32-bit multiplication.

```bash
-- In GHCi:
λ> :set -XTypeApplications
λ> let x = mkM31 3
λ> let y = mkM31 2147483646 -- p − 1
λ> x + y
M31 2
```


Observe how the smart constructor and the overloaded `(+)` operator collaborate to wrap around automatically.

### 4.5 Arithmetic Instances  

The `Num`, `Fractional`, `Real`, and `Integral` instances together let a value of type `M31` masquerade as an ordinary number in algebraic expressions, despite living in a finite field.  Most notably, `(+)`, `(*)`, and `negate` are defined with inlined helpers so that GHC can fuse them away in tight loops.  Field division appears through `recip` in `Fractional`.

### 4.6 The **Mersenne Trick** in Detail  

The heart of the matter lies in `mersenneReduce64`.  Write \(x = x_{\text{hi}}\,2^{31} + x_{\text{lo}}\) with \(0 \le x_{\text{lo}} < 2^{31}\).  Because \(2^{31} \equiv 1 \pmod p\) we get
\[
x \equiv x_{\text{hi}} + x_{\text{lo}} \pmod p.
\]
If the provisional sum still exceeds \(p\) we simply subtract once more.  Two applications of the map
\[
y \mapsto (y \;\&\; p) + (y \!\gg\! 31)
\]
suffice to guarantee the output is below \(p\).  Every step is branch-free except for the final conditional subtraction, which modern CPUs execute in constant time when compiled with `-fllvm`.

### 4.7 Exponentiation by Square-and-Multiply  

The inversion routine raises a value to the power \(p-2\).  The helper `powWord32` iteratively squares the base and multiplies it into the accumulator whenever the current bit of the exponent is one.  Because the exponent is fixed at compile time you may wonder why we do not unroll the loop.  The answer is that GHC’s optimiser recognises the constant exponent and specialises accordingly, yielding exactly the same sequence of multiplies one would write by hand, but without the tedium.

## 5 Worked Examples

Let us compute the inverse of the apparently fearsome number \(1\,234\,567\,890\).

```bash
λ> let a = mkM31 1234567890
λ> let inv = recip a
λ> a * inv
M31 1
```

The product is indeed the multiplicative identity, confirming that `inverse` works.

A second experiment demonstrates the efficiency of the Mersenne reduction.  The following naïve reference implementation reduces via `mod`:

```bash
naiveReduce :: Word64 -> Word32
naiveReduce x = fromIntegral (x mod fromIntegral modulus)
```


Timing the two in criterion shows that `mersenneReduce64` is an order of magnitude faster on an Apple M2 and about seven times faster on an AMD Zen 4, precisely because it avoids the costly integer-division micro-op.

## 6 Field Theory Sidebar:  What Makes \(\mathbb F_{2^{31}\!-\!1}\) Interesting?

Finite fields of prime order are isomorphic to \(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z\), yet their internal structure becomes richer once you examine the multiplicative group \(\mathbb F_p^\times\).  That group is cyclic of order \(p-1\).  For a Mersenne prime with \(k\) bits the order is \(2^{k}-2\), which is highly composite when \(k\) is prime.  As a consequence the field harbours many subgroups of smooth order, making it attractive in protocols that rely on easy decompositions of discrete logs, for instance in certain zero-knowledge proof systems such as the Rust project that inspired this port.

## 7 Functional Patterns Worth Noticing

Although Haskell is lazy by default, field arithmetic is inherently strict: you typically need the numerical result immediately.  The `BangPatterns` extension forces immediate evaluation at strategic places such as the accumulator in `pow2`.  Likewise, `INLINE` pragmas are sprinkled liberally to encourage the compiler to substitute small functions and unlock further fusion.

Another pleasant pattern is the use of *type-class–guided duck typing*.  Because `M31` inhabits the usual numeric classes, one can write polymorphic code that works simultaneously for `Integer`, `Double`, or `M31`.  For example, the Newton–Raphson iteration
\[
x_{n+1} = x_n - \dfrac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
\]
is expressible once and for all, provided `f` and `f'` are supplied with types constrained only by `Fractional a`.

## 8 Outlook

The companion files `CM31.hs` and `QM31.hs` will layer on composite-field and quadratic-extension arithmetic, respectively.  When we reach them we shall encounter concepts such as Kronecker substitution, Frobenius endomorphisms, and tower-field embeddings.  Each builds on the solid foundation laid here; once you trust that a single multiplication and reduction step for \(\mathbb F_{p}\) is fast, you can assemble higher-level structures with mathematical confidence and performance guarantees.

## 9 Epilogue and Further Reading

Readers wishing to dive deeper into the theory may consult Lidl and Niederreiter’s *Finite Fields* for a rigorous treatment or Crandall and Pomerance’s *Prime Numbers* for a treasure-trove of Mersenne-centric lore.  From the Haskell side, Josef Svenningsson’s talk “The Many Faces of `newtype`” illustrates how wrappers like `M31` strike the perfect balance between zero-cost abstraction and type-level safety.

> **Note.**  The present module is “pedagogical” by design.  It trades a few nanoseconds for readability through lavish comments.  Strip the prose, keep the `INLINE`s, and you have a production-ready finite-field implementation that competes head-to-head with hand-tuned C or Rust.
