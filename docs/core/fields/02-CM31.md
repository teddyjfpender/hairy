# Illuminated Notes on **`Field.CM31`**

The source file `Field.CM31` lifts the prime field  \(\mathbb F_{2^{31}-1}\) studied earlier into its quadratic extension
\[
\mathbb F_{p^2}\;=\;\mathbb F_{p}[i]\bigm/\!\left(i^2+1\right),
\qquad p = 2^{31}-1,
\]
where, by construction, the symbol \(i\) satisfies \(i^{2} = -1\).  Algebraically we now have a field of **order \(p^{2}\)** whose additive group is a two-dimensional vector space over \(\mathbb F_{p}\) and whose multiplicative group is cyclic of order \(p^{2}-1\).  Computationally we model an element as an ordered pair \((a,b)\) with \(a,b\in\mathbb F_{p}\), packaged in the Haskell data constructor

```hs
data CM31 = CM31 !M31 !M31
```

The exclamation marks and `{-# UNPACK #-}` pragmas ensure that each component is stored unboxed, so a `CM31` occupies the same eight bytes that the two `Word32`s would occupy in C.

## 1 Why Quadratic Extensions Matter

Within cryptography and zero-knowledge proof systems it is often convenient, or sometimes necessary, to work in a field that contains a square root of \(-1\) even when the base field does not.  Instead of hunting for the elusive non-trivial square root inside \(\mathbb F_{p}\) one may adjoin an indeterminate \(i\) and immediately gain \(i^{2}=-1\) by fiat, thereby guaranteeing that every quadratic polynomial splits.  The price is a mere factor-of-two increase in storage and an almost negligible overhead in arithmetic, as we shall shortly see.

## 2 From Functional Abstraction to Bare-Metal Speed

The module exploits the same zero-cost abstractions championed in `Field.M31`.  Because `CM31` is a strict algebraic data type with two strict fields, there is **no hidden pointer chasing** and no per-field thunk allocation.  Inlining rules handed to GHC by the `INLINE` pragmas allow the optimiser to fuse chains of basic operations, so that a long polynomial evaluation in \(\mathbb F_{p^2}\) is lowered to precisely the same sequence of word-size integer instructions that one would write in intrinsics-heavy C—only now it enjoys the correctness guarantees of the type system.

## 3 The Algebra Behind Each Instance

### 3.1 Addition and Subtraction  

Given \((a+bi)\) and \((c+di)\) the sum is \((a+c) + (b+d)i\).  Because `M31` is already a field, the expressions `a + c` and `b + d` automatically reduce modulo \(p\).  The `Num` instance therefore spells addition out exactly once, with no need for a post-hoc reduction step at the `CM31` level.

### 3.2 Multiplication  

The classical formula reads
\[
(a+bi)(c+di) = (ac - bd)\;+\;(ad + bc)\,i.
\]
Notice the deliberate **reuse** of `(*)`, `(-)`, and `(+`) from the `M31` instance.  Those operations are constant-time and already reduced, so the product in `CM31` is fully reduced by the time the constructor is applied.

### 3.3 Negation and Scalar Lifting  

Negation maps \((a,b)\) to \((-a,-b)\).  The `fromInteger` method interprets an ordinary integer \(n\) as the element \(( \overline n , 0 )\), with \(\overline n\) denoting reduction in the prime field; thus the prime field embeds *canonically* into its quadratic extension.

### 3.4 Multiplicative Inverse  

For a non-zero element \(z=a+bi\) we recall that
\[
z^{-1} \;=\;\frac{a-bi}{a^{2}+b^{2}}.
\]
Because \(a^{2}+b^{2}\) lies in the prime subfield, its reciprocal is computed by the `inverse` routine defined earlier for `M31`, after which two field multiplications finish the job.  The Haskell code hides these details inside the expression

```hs
let denom = a * a + b * b
in CM31 ( a / denom) (negate b / denom)
```


where each `/` is the *prime-field* division.

## 4 Examples in the Interpreter

The following transcript illustrates typical arithmetic.  Since nested Markdown fences would terminate the single code block, we indent four spaces.

    λ> import Field.CM31
    λ> let x = mkCM31 3 5          -- 3 + 5 i
    λ> let y = mkCM31 9 2          -- 9 + 2 i
    λ> x * y
    2 + 49i
    λ> recip x
    1474836457 + 1717986916i
    λ> x * recip x
    1 + 0i

Observe that \(x x^{-1} = 1\) as mandated by field axioms, with every intermediate reduction executed invisibly by the underlying `M31` operations.

## 5 Mathematical Side Notes

1. **Size of the Multiplicative Group.**  The group \(\mathbb F_{p^{2}}^{\times}\) has order \(p^{2}-1 = \bigl(2^{31}-1\bigr)^{2}-1\), which factors as \((p-1)(p+1)\).  Because the first term is extremely smooth (it is a multiple of powers of two) and the second term is likewise even, the group contains many low-order elements.  This property is useful in constructing roots of unity for fast Fourier transforms inside finite fields.

2. **Quadratic Extensions and Conjugation.**  The map
   \[
   \overline{\,a+bi\,} \;=\; a-bi
   \]
   is an \(\mathbb F_{p}\)-linear involution whose fixed field is precisely the prime subfield.  Geometrically one views \(\mathbb F_{p^{2}}\) as a two-dimensional plane, with conjugation acting as reflection across the real axis.

3. **Frobenius Automorphism.**  Because \(p\equiv 3\pmod 4\) we have
   \[
   (a+bi)^{p} \;=\; a - bi.
   \]
   Hence the Frobenius map coincides with conjugation, a fact that simplifies many algorithms in cryptographic pairings.

## 6 Perspectives on Type-Driven Design

In an imperative language one must manually remember to reduce each coordinate after every arithmetic operation, a fertile ground for subtle timing leaks or logic bugs.  In contrast, the Haskell approach encodes the reduction guarantee inside the *constructor*; the only way to manufacture an ill-formed value is to circumvent the module’s export list, which client code cannot do.  Equational reasoning becomes straightforward: when you write `(a * c - b * d)` you may treat each product as already reduced, because the `Num` instance for `M31` has promised this property.

## 7 Closing Thoughts

`Field.CM31` demonstrates how to ascend from a well-understood prime field to its quadratic cousin while preserving constant-time behaviour and zero-overhead abstraction.  In the sequel `QM31.hs` we will see how to climb another rung up the field-tower ladder, culminating in a quartic extension whose structure underpins advanced protocols such as PLONK and STARKs.

> *In algebra as in software architecture, the best abstractions disappear, leaving behind only the essence of the computation.*  Here that essence is the elegant identity \(i^{2}=-1\), rendered into machine code by a purely functional compiler and executed in nanoseconds by modern silicon.
