# A Deep-Dive Commentary on **`Field.QM31`**

The file `Field.QM31` crowns our miniature tower of finite-field constructions.  Having met the prime field  \(\mathbb F_{p}\) with \(p = 2^{31}-1\) and its quadratic extension \(\mathbb F_{p}[i]/(i^{2}+1)\), we now ascend to a **quartic extension**
\[
\mathbb F_{p}[u]\bigm/\!\bigl(u^{2}-(2+i)\bigr),
\]
where the constant
\[
r \;=\; 2 + i
\]
lives inside the complex extension field \(\mathbb F_{p^{2}}\).  In algebraic terms we have adjoined a square root of \(r\), thereby guaranteeing that every polynomial of degree at most four splits over the resulting field \(\mathbb F_{p^{4}}\).  In Haskell the same idea materialises as an ordinary strict data constructor

```hs
data QM31 = QM31 !CM31 !CM31
```


which stores the coefficients of \(1\) and \(u\).

## 1 Context and Motivation

Quartic extensions appear naturally in modern cryptography, for instance in pairing-friendly curves of BLS-type and in lookup arguments of polynomial commitment schemes.  A recurring motive is that the multiplicative group \(\mathbb F_{p^{4}}^{\times}\) factors as
\[
(p^{2}+1)(p^{2}-1),
\]
thereby providing elements of smooth orders that make certain computational problems easier and others, crucially, no harder.

---

## 2 The Algebra of the Extension

Inside \(\mathbb F_{p^{4}}\) the element \(u\) satisfies \(u^{2}=r\) and hence \(u^{3}=ru\).  Every field element is uniquely representable as
\[
a + b\,u
\qquad\text{with } a,b\in\mathbb F_{p^{2}}.
\]
Multiplication follows directly from the defining relation:
\[
(a+bu)(c+du) \;=\; (ac + rbd) \;+\; (ad+bc)u.
\]
The code mirrors this identity verbatim in the `(*)` method of the `Num` instance.  Reduction within the base field is automatic because each embedded operation `(*)` or `+` is itself an operation on `CM31`, which has already been proven to leave results inside the correct range.

---

## 3 From Algebra to Haskell

The Haskell programme embodies the field axioms through type-class instances in much the same way that a textbook lists the axioms of a field and checks that the representation satisfies them.  Every instance method is annotated with `INLINE`, encouraging the GHC optimiser to fuse chains of operations so that, for example, a long Horner evaluation of a degree-\(k\) polynomial in \(u\) becomes a tight block of machine integer arithmetic.

Strictness annotations `!` once again play a starring role.  Without the bangs each `QM31` value would lazily hold two thunks, perhaps each lazily holding two more thunks inside `CM31`.  By forcing evaluation on construction we ensure that time and space costs remain predictable, an especially valuable property in cryptographic code where timing uniformity is mandatory.

## 4 Details of the Implementation

### 4.1 Smart Constructors

The function

```
mkQM31 a0 a1 a2 a3 =
QM31 (mkCM31 a0 a1) (mkCM31 a2 a3)
```


takes four raw `Word32`s and funnels them through `mkCM31`, thereby guaranteeing that each coordinate is reduced modulo \(p\).  No client code can bypass this constructor because the plain `QM31` data constructor is not exported.

### 4.2 Scalar Multiplication

Field elements often need to be multiplied by scalars from a subfield.  The helper `mulCM31` multiplies both coordinates of a `QM31` by the same `CM31`.  Because `CM31` multiplication is constant-time, the whole routine is.

### 4.3 The Inverse

For \(z = a+bu\) we may verify
\[
z^{-1}
  \;=\;
  \frac{a - bu}{\,a^{2} - b^{2}r - b^{2}ir\,},
\]
where \(i\) denotes the complex unit.  The code computes \(b^{2}\), decomposes it into real and imaginary parts, rotates these by \(i\) to obtain \(i b^{2}\), and finally forms the denominator
\[
a^{2} - 2b^{2} - i b^{2}.
\]
Because the denominator lives in \(\mathbb F_{p^{2}}\), the existing `recip` for `CM31` suffices.  Multiplying numerator and denominator by the reciprocal yields the desired inverse.  Throughout, every intermediate value is a `CM31` or `M31`, so no ad-hoc reductions appear at the quartic level.

## 5 Worked Session

    λ> import Field.QM31
    λ> let z = mkQM31 7 1 3 9              -- (7+ i) + (3+9i)u
    λ> let w = recip z
    λ> z * w
    1 + 0u
    λ> let s = mulCM31 z (mkCM31 2 5)      -- scalar multiply by 2+5i
    λ> s
    17 + 116u

Each command runs in constant time and performs exactly the word-sized operations predicted by the algebraic formulas.

## 6 Field Tower Visualised

The extension hierarchy may be pictured as a sequence of vector-space embeddings.

   ℱ_p                    (dimension 1)
    │  adjoin i
    ▼
   ℱ_{p²} = ℱ_p[i]        (dimension 2)
    │  adjoin u with u²=r
    ▼
   ℱ_{p⁴} = ℱ_{p²}[u]     (dimension 2 over ℱ_{p²})


Consequently \(\mathbb F_{p^{4}}\) has dimension four over the prime field.  Every ascent multiplies storage and computational cost by a constant factor, but in return unlocks new algebraic structure such as eighth and twelfth roots of unity, which are indispensable in FFT-based proof systems.

## 7 Type-Level Safety and Equational Reasoning

Because the only way to build a `QM31` is through `mkQM31`, the field invariant is maintained automatically.  Further, the term language of Haskell mirrors the algebra: one may replace equals by equals, commute strict and lazy evaluations, and so on, exactly as in pencil-and-paper derivations.  This synergy is particularly striking when one translates short algebraic proofs—say, that inversion is involutive—into corresponding QuickCheck properties; the required coding effort is delightfully small.

## 8 Looking Ahead

With \(\mathbb F_{p^{4}}\) in hand you are equipped to tackle pairings on the BLS12-381 curve, implement the inverse FFT over cosets necessary in the PLONK protocol, or experiment with cryptanalytic attacks that exploit the availability of multiple field embeddings.  The Haskell skeleton provided here serves as a trustworthy and performant foundation.
